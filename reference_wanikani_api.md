WaniKani API v2
Revision 20170710
https://docs.api.wanikani.com/20170710/#assignments

Introduction
Welcome to "WaniKani: The API!" You can use our API to access progress data for a user's account and a ton of general reference data for the subjects within WaniKani.

This version is built around a RESTful structure, with consistent, resource-oriented URLs. We support that structure with standard HTTP features: HTTP verbs for all our endpoints to indicate different actions, HTTP authentication headers, and HTTP response codes to indicate both success and various errors. We've turned on cross-origin resource sharing to allow for secure client-side access. We respond to all requests with JSON, making it easy to parse those responses into native objects in a variety of languages. These should open up the API to any client that supports these features and data structures.

We've got information on general usage, like authentication and error codes, in Getting Started. We make a few suggestions on how to optimize your usage of the API in Best Practices and clarify a few obscure topics under Additional Information. Finally, details for all of the available resources and endpoints are under Resources.

Feel free to reach out via email or through the community if you have any questions, comments, or requests about the API.

Getting Started
Authentication
To authorize, use this code:

curl "https://api.wanikani.com/v2/<api_endpoint_here>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token_here>"
Make sure to replace <api_token_here> with the API key.

WaniKani uses your secret API token to authenticate requests to the API. You can obtain and manage your v2 token in Settings / API Tokens on WaniKani. The token has to be included with every request, and should be delivered in a HTTP header that looks like:

Authorization: Bearer <api_token_here>

Also note that all requests must be made over HTTPS. Any requests made over HTTP or without authentication headers will fail.

 You must replace <api_token_here> with the your API key.
Response Structure
We return JSON from all the API endpoints, even when an error occurs.

There are two main structures we return: resources and collections. Singular resource endpoints deliver information about a single entity, such as an assignment or subject. Collections contain summary data about a bunch of resources, and also include each of the resources.

There's a third type of structure that's less common: a report. Reports summarize disparate or novel information into a single place, and don't follow the same structure as collections.

Resources follow the pattern:

{
  "id": <integer>,
  "object": <string>,
  "url": <string>,
  "data_updated_at": <date>,
  "data": <object>
}
And collections look like:

{
  "object": <string>,
  "url": <string>,
  "pages": {
    "next_url": <string_or_null>,
    "previous_url": <string_or_null>,
    "per_page": <integer>
  },
  "total_count": <integer>,
  "data_updated_at": <date_or_null>,
  "data": <array_of_objects>
}
All of the responses have a few shared, high-level attributes: object, url, data_updated_at, and data.

Attribute	Description
object	The kind of object returned. See the object types section below for all the kinds.
url	The URL of the request. For collections, that will contain all the filters and options you've passed to the API. Resources have a single URL and don't need to be filtered, so the URL will be the same in both resource and collection responses.
data_updated_at	For collections, this is the timestamp of the most recently updated resource in the specified scope and is not limited by pagination. If no resources were returned for the specified scope, then this will be null. For a resource, then this is the last time that particular resource was updated.
data	For collections, this is going to be the resources returned by the specified scope. For resources, these are the attributes that are specific to that particular instance and kind of resource.
Object Types
Every successful API response contains an object attribute that tells you which kind of thing you're getting. As mentioned before, there are two object types that return information on many different resources:

collection
report
The following are singular resources:

assignment
kana_vocabulary
kanji
level_progression
radical
reset
review_statistic
review
spaced_repetition_system
study_material
user
vocabulary
voice_actor
Data Types
We stick to the common JSON data types in our responses: strings, integers, booleans, arrays, and objects. We follow the Javascript standard for date formatting, returning them in ISO 8601 format, rounded to the microsecond.

Pagination
Collection Size
By default, the maximum number of resources returned for collection endpoints is 500. Some endpoints may return a different size — reviews and subjects have a maximum size of 1,000.

Any collection response has the per-page count in the pages.per_page attribute. Those same responses have a total_count attribute, too. That is a count of all resources available within the specified scope, not limited to pagination.

Pagination in Action
When there are more resources to return than the per-page limit, we use a cursor-based pagination scheme to move through the pages of results. We use the id of a resource as the cursor.

Collections have the following nested within a pages attribute:

Attribute	Data Type	Description
next_url	null or String	The URL of the next page of results. If there are no more results, the value is null.
previous_url	null or String	The URL of the previous page of results. If there are no results at all or no previous page to go to, the value is null.
per_page	Integer	Maximum number of resources delivered for this collection.
 Pro tip: the first page has no previous page, and the last page has no next page.
The previous page of results can be requested by passing in the page_before_id parameter, with the value being the id you want to look before. Similar logic applies for the next page. Pass in the page_after_id parameter with with the id you want to look after.

If a cursor is outside the range of ids for the collection, an empty result set is returned for data.

Example
Let’s say there are four resources with IDs of 1, 2, 3, 4.

If we make a request with ...?page_after_id=2, then we'll get resources with IDs 3 and 4.
If we make a request with ...?page_before_id=3, then we'll get resources with IDs 1 and 2.
If we make a request with ...?page_after_id=5, then we'll get a collection with an empty data field.
Filters
Collections have optional filters to help narrow the results returned. The filters are passed in as URL parameters, like ?parameter=value&other_parameter=value.

Any time we take a query parameter that's listed as an array data type, we take that array as a comma delimited list of values. A single value is also valid.

So, if a collection endpoint takes subject_ids as an argument for filtering results, your requests might have the following formats:

A single-member subject_ids request: ...?subject_ids=8
A multiple-member subject_ids request: ...?subject_ids=8,16,64
Errors
Errors with a message will return with the follow response body structure:

{ "error": <string>, "code": <integer> }
We use standard HTTP response codes to indicate the status of the response. Codes in the 200s indicate success, 400s usually indicate a client configuration problem (that's you), while 500s indicate that something bad is happening on the server (that's us).

The codes are presented in the header of the response; some error responses will also contain a body with the message specified below:

Code	Meaning	Message
200	Success	n/a
401	Unauthorized	“Unauthorized. Nice try.”
403	Forbidden	
404	Not Found	
409	Conflict	
422	Unprocessable Entity	Description of how the request was malformed.
429	Too Many Requests	
500	Internal Server Error	n/a
503	Service Unavailable	n/a
Rate Limit
We enforce the following rate limits to ensure decent response times for everyone using the API:

Throttle	Value
Requests per minute	60
An HTTP status code of 429 (Forbidden) and a body with the message Rate Limit Exceeded is returned if the limits are exceeded (shocking, we know).

In the response headers, the following rate limit information is provided:

Header	Description
RateLimit-Limit	The rate limit for the current period.
RateLimit-Remaining	The remaining rate available for the current period.
RateLimit-Reset	The timestamp of when the rate limit will reset. The value is epoch time in seconds.
It is recommended to make use of the header rate limit details to programatically handle HTTP status code 429 responses in an optimal way.

Revisions (aka Versioning)
To define the revision, use this code:

curl "https://api.wanikani.com/v2/<api_endpoint_here>" \
  -H "Wanikani-Revision: 20170710" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token_here>"
Any time we make ‘breaking changes’ to the API, we release a new, timestamped revision of the API. Non-breaking changes don't trigger a new revision, and those changes are available in all versions of the API.

A breaking change is anything that changes the existing structure of a response, e.g. the renaming of a field in a resource.
Non-breaking changes are things like exposing new resource attributes or adding whole new endpoints.
Revisions are designated by timestamps in the format YYYYMMDD. We expect the revision to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following: Wanikani-Revision: 20170710.

 If you don't specify a revision, the API will default to the first revision: 20170710.
Best Practices
We're always working to make the API as performant as possible, but there are a few things you can do to optimize your use of the data we deliver and speed things up when you need to make new requests: cache data locally whenever possible, make conditional requests to minimize network load, and make use of the updated_after filter on a lot of the endpoints.

When you're building applications or services that other people will use, there's also some work to be done to respect the access to content granted by a subscription to WaniKani (per our terms and generally being a good citizen).

Caching
Most of the data on WaniKani doesn't change that often, so long-lived caches or more permanent stores that are periodically updated can eliminate a lot of time-consuming requests and help with offline functionality, if that's something you're after.

Here are a few recommendations that might influence what you cache and how long you keep it around:

Cache subjects as aggressively as possible. They aren't very frequently updated, and you'll probably need to access them frequently. They're the object that ties together assignments, review statistics, and study materials.
Reviews and resets are never changed once recorded, but reviews are created frequently. You can put these two in long-term storage if you need them.
Assignments, review statistics, and study materials have moderate levels of updates. When a user levels up or passes a a subject, there might be a small flurry of activity with new assignments being created and existing records being updated. As an assignment gets further and further along in the SRS stages, those updates will become less and less frequent.
The summary report changes every hour. Caching the results of this request might help with offline activity, but the data changes, well, every hour.
The user endpoint isn't updated a ton, but when it does, it's going to be pretty important to capture.
Do take note any of the above recommendations may become outdated, but we will try out best to communicate these changes.

Caching is always tricky business. When do you expire it? How do you refresh it? Who's in charge of it?

We've done a couple things to try and help with a couple of the problems around caching. The first is to support conditional requests, which lets us quickly tell you that a record hasn't changed since you got it last. The second is to give you tools to get only the updated or new records after any point in time, letting you easily refresh your local data caches and stores without having to parse all the records.

Conditional Requests
We accept the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers for every endpoint. If the response body hasn't changed since the last request, then a HTTP status code 304 (Not Modified) and an empty response body is returned. The advantage to using these headers is a faster response time since we don't have to generate a full response; we assume you still have the unmodified data cached.

Each response includes the ETag and Last-Modified headers that are used to populate If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since, respectively. These values can be used in future requests at the matching endpoint.

If both If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since are passed in, then If-None-Match takes precedence.

If-Modified-Since
To define If-Modified-Since, use this code:

curl "<api_endpoint_here>"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token_here>"
  -H "Wanikani-Revision: 20170710"
  -H "If-Modified-Since: <last_modified_date_here>"
Make sure to replace <last_modified_date_here> with the Last-Modified value extracted from a previous response header or any datetime.

The If-Modified-Since request header takes in a Last-Modified value from the last request — or any datetime — in the following format:

If-Modified-Since: <day-name>, <day> <month> <year> <hour>:<minute>:<second> GMT

Where:

<day-name> — One of "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", or "Sun" (case-sensitive).
<day> — 2 digit day number, e.g. "04" or "23".
<month> — One of "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec" (case sensitive).
<year> — 4 digit year number, e.g. "1990" or "2016".
<hour> — 2 digit hour number, e.g. "09" or "23".
<minute> — 2 digit minute number, e.g. "04" or "59".
<second> — 2 digit second number, e.g. "04" or "59".
GMT — Greenwich Mean Time. HTTP dates are always expressed in GMT, never in local time.
Example: If-Modified-Since: Fri, 11 Nov 2011 11:11:11 GMT

The generally-excellent MDN web docs have more information on the If-Modified-Since header.

If-None-Match
To define If-None-Match, use this code:

curl "<api_endpoint_here>"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_token_here>"
  -H "Wanikani-Revision: 20170710"
  -H "If-None-Match: <etag_here>"
Make sure to replace <etag_here> with the ETag value extracted from a previous response header.

The If-None-Match request header takes in an ETag value from the last request's response header:

If-None-Match: <etag_here>

The MDN web docs have more information on the If-None-Match header, too.

Leveraging the updated_after Filter
All of the collection endpoints support an updated_after filter. As you'd guess, that's going to only return records that have been updated after the timestamp you pass to us.

Example/Scenario/Not a Fable
How does that help with performance and caching? By only returning the records you need.

Let's say you're building a statistics site. You need to know about all the subjects plus get all of a user's assignments, review statistics, reviews, resets, and level progressions to figure out how they've done in the past and do some guesswork on how they might do in the future.

Focusing in on the assignments, let's say you decide to re-calculate a user's progress every time they log in to use your site. Without the updated_after filter, you'd have to grab all their assignments, since there'd be no way to tell which ones had changed until after you retrieved them all. For high level users, that could be 18 sequential requests! Once you've made them sit through that progress bar, you'd need to parse all the results and compare to them what you've stored locally.

With the updated_after filter, though, you can ask for only the records that have changed since the last time that user logged in, getting a smaller, faster response full of records you know you have to update or add internally. Even high activity users are only going to touch a small portion of their assignments at a time. We can generate that list of records far more rapidly, it'll be a smaller payload, and you probably won't need to page through results to get everything that you need.

Respecting Subscription Restrictions
WaniKani has paid subscriptions. That may come as a surprise in 2025, but it's true. Those subscriptions grant access to all the content past level three and let people to do lessons and reviews for that content.

When the API is used for your own uses (populating spreadsheets, backing up progress, etc.), those access restrictions don't have that much of an impact. Most of the data delivered by the API belongs to you: assignments, study materials, review statistics, and those bits about how you progress through WaniKani. The only data that isn't yours is the content in subjects. All those mnemonics, hints, and relationships have been painstakingly crafted by the WaniKani staff to make learning kanji faster and better. That content is covered by pertinent copyright laws — which also means that fair use allows you to use it to learn on your own.

Once you start building tools that can be used by other people, things change, though. First, you can't use the content to build anything that's for profit. Second, you need to respect the limitations put in place by the subscriptions. Both of those requirements are per our terms. So, how do you do meet those requirements?

The user endpoint has a subscription attribute. That should have everything you need.

max_level_granted defines the maximum level of content that's available to the user. It has two possible values: 3 and 60. The user shouldn't be able to access subjects above those levels. Lessons and reviews above those levels shouldn't be available at all and will be rejected if you try and submit them to us.
active is a boolean that tells you if the person has an active subscription.
type defines the kind of subscription, and works closely with period_ends_at. There are four values:
free subscriptions aren't really subscriptions, but can represent people who've never subscribed or have an inactive subscription. There's no period_ends_at for free subscriptions.
recurring subscriptions renew on a periodic basis. period_ends_at tells you when the subscription renews or expires. Since we give people access until the end of their subscription period even if they cancel, you can generally not check their subscription status until that time.
lifetime means the user can access WaniKani forever. period_ends_at is null, mainly because ∞ is hard for computers to get. It's possible that a lifetime user will ask for a refund or have payment difficulties, so scheduled checks on the subscription status are still needed.
unknown means the user subscription state isn't exactly known. This is a weird state on WaniKani, should be treated as free, and reported to the WaniKani developers.
Your application can use max_level_granted as a first, easy line of defense. That restricts content access based on their subscription, and is most of what you need to do. The active, type, and period_ends_at fields are all their to let you build more robust solutions. Those help you figure out when your application needs to check up on subscription status (if ever) or do things like expire access if the user hasn't connected in a while.

Additional Information
Spaced Repetition System
Our spaced repetition systems determine how subjects progress from being unavailable to users (locked) through complete memorization (burned). The knowledge guide has some good general information about how we use SRS in WaniKani.

A single spaced repetition system consists of N number of sequential stages. Each stage describes its position in the sequence as well as the time interval that’s used to determine when the subject will appear next in reviews.

Each system has the following common characteristics.

Special stage name	Stage position/number	Description
Unlocking stage	0	This is the initial stage for an assignment; it generally indicates the subject will appear in lessons.
Starting stage	1	The minimum stage for a subject to appear in reviews.
Passing stage	Value from the starting stage position up to the burning stage position	Reaching this milestone counts towards level progression and the unlocking of additional subjects.
Burning stage	N	This is the stage when the subject is complete, exits out of reviews and is no longer tested.
As mentioned before, we use the SRS stages to calculate the time until the next review (the 'space' in the 'spaced-repetition').

If the review goes well and there are no wrong answers, we move the assignment up to the next SRS stage. We make the assignment available 'interval' hours from now, at the top of the hour. For example: given an assignment at stage 1, when we submit a correct answer at 3:31pm, the assignment would move to SRS stage 2 and become available for another review at 11:00pm.
If there are wrong answers, we decrease the SRS stage based on the number of times it was wrong, and then again make it available according to the interval for that SRS stage.
User Resets
Users have the option to reset their account to a target level at or below their current level.

Resets will show up in a variety of places. Explicit records will show up under resets. They'll get a fresh level progression for the target level of the reset, and the level progression for the level they abandoned gets an abandoned_at timestamp. Finally, the assignments and review_statistics for the affected levels will get set back to their default state, waiting to be unlocked or started, depending on the levels.

Resources
Assignments
Assignments contain information about a user's progress on a particular subject, including their current state and timestamps for various progress milestones. Assignments are created when a user has passed all the components of the given subject and the assignment is at or below their current level for the first time.

Level Progressions
Level progressions contain information about a user's progress through the WaniKani levels.

A level progression is created when a user has met the prerequisites for leveling up, which are:

Reach a 90% passing rate on assignments for a user's current level with a subject_type of kanji. Passed assignments have data.passed equal to true and a data.passed_at that's in the past.
Have access to the level. Under /user, the data.level must be less than or equal to data.subscription.max_level_granted.

Reviews
Reviews are submitted to update Assignments and associated Review Statistics records in WaniKani. Reviews are submitted when a user answers all the parts of a subject correctly once; some subjects have both meaning or reading parts, and some only have one or the other. Note that reviews are not to be submitted for the quizzes in lessons, instead the Start an Assignment endpoint should be used.

ending_srs_stage	Integer	The SRS stage interval calculated from the number of correct and incorrect answers, with valid values ranging from 1 to 9
incorrect_meaning_answers	Integer	The number of times the user has answered the meaning incorrectly.
incorrect_reading_answers	Integer	The number of times the user has answered the reading incorrectly.
spaced_repetition_system_id	Integer	Unique identifier of the associated spaced_repetition_system.
starting_srs_stage	Integer	The starting SRS stage interval, with valid values ranging from 1 to 8
subject_id	Integer	Unique identifier of the associated subject.
Notes
Incorrect Answers
A subject (radical, kanji, vocabulary, and kana_vocabulary) may not require a meaning or reading. Therefore attributes incorrect_meaning_answers and incorrect_reading_answers will return a value of 0 for subjects which do not have the requirement.

Subject type	Answer types allowed
kana_vocabulary	Meaning
kanji	Meaning, Reading
radical	Meaning
vocabulary	Meaning, Reading
Spaced Repetition System
The associated spaced repetition system is the system used to do the SRS stage calculations at the time the review record was created. It does not necessarily mean it is the current spaced_repetition_system associated to subject. This is done to preserve history.

Updates an assignment and associated review statisitc for a specific assignment_id. Using the related subject_id is also a valid alternative to using assignment_id.

Some criteria must be met in order for an assignment to be updated: available_at must be not null and in the past.

When a review is registered, the associated assignment and review_statistic are both updated. These are returned in the response body under resources_updated.

 We no longer persist review data. In order to honor the API contract, we return an unpersisted review with an id that is always 0.
HTTP Request
POST https://api.wanikani.com/v2/reviews/

Allowed Parameters
Name	Data Type	Required?	Description
assignment_id	Integer	true	Unique identifier of the assignment. This or subject_id must be set.
subject_id	Integer	true	Unique identifier of the subject. This or assignment_id must be set.
incorrect_meaning_answers	Integer	true	Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the meaning was answered incorrectly.
incorrect_reading_answers	Integer	true	Must be zero or a positive number. This is the number of times the reading was answered incorrectly. Note that subjects with a type or radical do not quiz on readings. Thus, set this value to 0.
created_at	Date	false	Timestamp when the review was completed. Defaults to the time of the request if omitted from the request body. Must be in the past, but after assignment.available_at.
Review Statistics
Review statistics summarize the activity recorded in reviews. They contain sum the number of correct and incorrect answers for both meaning and reading. They track current and maximum streaks of correct answers. They store the overall percentage of correct answers versus total answers.

A review statistic is created when the user has done their first review on the related subject.

Attribute	Data Type	Description
burning_stage_position	Integer	position of the burning stage.
created_at	Date	Timestamp when the spaced_repetition_system was created.
description	String	Details about the spaced repetition system.
name	String	The name of the spaced repetition system
passing_stage_position	Integer	position of the passing stage.
stages	Array of objects	A collection of stages. See table below for the object structure.
starting_stage_position	Integer	position of the starting stage.
unlocking_stage_position	Integer	position of the unlocking stage.
The _position fields align with the timestamps on assignment: unlocking_stage_position => unlocked_at, passing_stage_position => passed_at, etc.

Stages Object Attributes
Attribute	Data Type	Description
interval	null or Integer	The length of time added to the time of review registration, adjusted to the beginning of the hour.
interval_unit	null or String	Unit of time. Can be the following: milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks.
position	Integer	The position of the stage within the continuous order.
The unlocking (position 0) and burning (maximum position) will always have null for interval and interval_unit since the stages do not influence assignment.available_at. Stages in between the unlocking and burning stages are the “reviewable” stages.
